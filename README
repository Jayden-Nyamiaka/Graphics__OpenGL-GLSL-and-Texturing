Compile and Execute Instructions:

    1) The run "make all" to generate the executable, which cleans before compiling.

    2) To run the executable, run ./opengl scene_description_file.txt xres yres mode
                               OR ./opengl color_texture.png normal_map.png 
    
    3) You can also compile and run the demo via:
        - Compile: make demo
        - Run: make run_demo
                 OR ./demo/demoRenderer xres yres

    4) Run "make clean" to delete any generated files.


Notes:
    The texture shader still doesn't work perfectly. My texture shaders have been confirmed correct; 
    however, there is a problem somehwere on the C++ side. The code now runs displaying a white screen 
    and distorted textures. It's clear the texture is overlaying the flat square, but it's not working 
    correctly. I have tried looking over the code so many times, but I can't figure it out. It may be 
    an issue with the order in which OpenGl expects things to be called.
